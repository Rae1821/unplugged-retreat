üìçWhat is this project about?

The Unplugged retreat website is a multipage website that was created mobile first and is fully responsive. 
It features Google Map integration and custom code.

üìç Why did you want to build this project?

This was a project for the Coding Responsive class at Skillcrush. 
I was excited to build this project because I know how important it is to build websites mobile first so I was excited to learn such an important skill. 
We were given the .psd files for the mobile, tablet, and desktop views and we had to use those to get sizing, typography, images, icons, etc.


üìç What hurdles/problems did you run into?

This was one of the first responsive sites I did and I discovered just how frustrating it can be when everything looks great on one view and then it's messed up in another view. 
I struggled with the spacing of things at first and getting the images to show up correctly. 
I also struggled with getting the navigation to display correctly on all sizes.

üìç How did you overcome these problems?

First I realized that I really didn't have a full grasp of Flexbox so I went back and reviewed everything in the class. 
Then I went through section by section and worked through just the mobile .psd first. 
I used the Chrome devtools to figure out where padding and margin was being applied on each element. 
That was a game changer because it allowed me to see the exact place where the issue was, making it easy for me to target that element and fix the issue. 
I made sure I got the spacing correct on each section before moving on to the next. 
I also used W3schools.com to get more information on using flex box to help me get the spacing correct.

üìç What did you learn from this project?

This project was great and taught me so much about making sites responsive! 
I learned how to find all the measurements I need from the photoshop design and translate those into code. 
I also learned how to successfully use media queries and most importantly, I learned the value of having some great resources to turn to when you are stuck.
